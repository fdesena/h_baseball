*Data analysis of US baseball teams - Data Management & SQL - DAT-5486 course.*
# This is an introductory exercise for beginners in SQL.
#### As a suggestion you can use MySQL Workbench to solve these exercises since it is a free and open source platform. 

For MySQL to run locally on your laptop we need to install two applications: MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench

1. Windows Users: https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/installer/ (Install version 8.0.26). Or MAC Users: https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/community/Links (download version 8.0.26).
2. After that, install the workbench: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/



# About the database:
#### The database contains salary data for baseball players for the years 2009, 2011, 2018, and 2022.

I am not providing the database, however you can inspire in the queries I have used to answer related questions to answer similar questions using your own database.

1. Here you will find the solution for the following questions:

2. What is the % salary increase, on average, for a pitcher between 2018 and 2011?

3. Which team(s) have seen decreases in their total salary budgets across the years?

4. Which are players who have been around since 2009 with the same position?

5. Which players changed teams between 2018 and 2022?
